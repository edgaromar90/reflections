1. When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your 
work local?
   This can have different purposes, if you want to do it for security, in case
your computer crash down, or if you want to do it, because you want to share it
or maybe you want to bring people to work with you.

2. Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git 
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
   Because sometimes you don't want the changes that other people made, or you 
don't want to pull it at certain point, because you're working on something that
has to be ready before integrating it with the remote version.

3. Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you 
use one instead of another?
   A branch is a copy of the main "repository", but locally. While clones 
operates on branches, because they copy a branch, but they also do it from a 
remote repository. FInally we have the Fork, this is the same as clone, but it's
 a built-in tool that offers GitHub to do a clone on the website.

4. What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote 
stored locally?
   You can easily check what are the changes that have been made, and you can 
merge it when you think you're ready.
